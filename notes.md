[x] Highlighting
[ ] Inline errors current document
[ ] Project build, nicely formatted errors.
[ ] Autocomplete








IMPROVEMENTS https://github.com/Railk/T3S
[ ] Only check on save, not type? Right now it highlights random stuff
[ ] Make it faster
[ ] Build?






TODO
----
[x] Syntax Highlighting
[ ] Build Support (compile one file, double-click works)
[ ] inline-errors / linting (like sublime linter st3)

[ ] Typescript-tools: make autocomplete work
[ ] Ownership / Package control


https://github.com/Railk/T3S
- works great! must be installed via git with dependencies

https://github.com/lavrton/sublime-better-typescript
- has those other features that you like.... 

[ ] OK: wait until the T3S author responds. If he's responsive, help him get up, otherwise, put one up yourself. 
[ ] Tweak so you don't just have to change stuff

Current Typescript 0.9.1

Language Services
 - npm install: doesn't seem to install the language services
 - the language services AND the compiler are written in typescript

[ ] Need: the source for that text editor. Where do you get the language services from?


Why not use typescript tools? Make a binding like their vim binding. 




BUILD SUPPORT
-------------

Default should be to compile the open file in place, right?



LANGUAGE SUPPORT
----------------

Microsoft doesn't distribute the latest .tmLanguage. This is probably the best one, or we can look at others. 

The one in this repo is the one they originally published. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled.aspx









https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/tree/sublime-text-3
- they have line-highlighting and error showing working



http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/sublime-text-3/extensibility/plugins.html
- sublime text has a specific auto complete type
